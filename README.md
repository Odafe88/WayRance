# WayRance

### Description
WayRance is a Waste Management solution that utilizes the Toronet Blockchain Testnet. 
It solves this by Rewarding individuals/organizations based on the Amount of waste they successfully Submit, Record and Validate.

## How Does it work?
1. Users (Disposers) register on the platform and are Immediately led to a dashboard where the can upload infomation on the Waste they want to Submit.
2. Waste's are the Validated by WayRance Admin and a time for Pickup is scheduled via email.
3. Disposers ae then rewarded based on the data on the waste they have submitted. 

## How are funs generated?
Funds are generated primarily from sales of waste to Recycling plants. These funds are then used to reward disposers and cover operational costs.
The Project will only focus on two types of Waste Materials: Plastic and Metals.

- This is an original work by our team. We build on top of the following tooling: React, TailwindCSS, Wagmi, Ethers.Js, Toronet.
